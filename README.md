# Readme Generator

Readme Generator is a simple web interface for creating GitHub Readme files. I created it so that I could quickly and efficiently make or re-make the readme files for my various repos and maintain a consistent format.

## Project Setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
